i need you to go into ./nvim/lua/ and take the configurations and convert it into a 
usable vscode configurations, i only need the keybindings, fuzzy finding stuff like telescope 
and typescript you do not need to support any other languages in this vscode config
you can find the plugins i install in ./modules/nvim.nix
