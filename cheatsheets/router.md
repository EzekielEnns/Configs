[for dealing with Telus fibre and going into bridge](https://forum.telus.com/t5/Internet-Home-Phone/Telus-Pure-Fiber-in-Bridge-mode-with-modem-NH20A/td-p/139405)
since telus sometimes deletes these things:
```
Iâ€™m not sure why someone at Telus would tell you to configure NH20A in the method that they have.
First thing I would do is factory reset the NAH.
Make sure after you plug either a computer or laptop into any of the lan ports, you receive a 192.168 1.X IP address.
Navigate to the user interface which is located at 192.168.1.254. The username is admin, and the password 
is located under the top cover of the NAH. Please note password his indeed case-sensitive.
Making sure you have turned on the admin interface. Navigate to the network setting on the left-hand side, 
then to the LAN tab on the top, you should see the ability to enable bridge mode. You may have set the configuration,
and then save the settings prior to being able to go back into those settings for a more granular configuration.
This configuration is specifically for the in NH20A, and not the Technicolor FX5000. Technicolor has slightly different 
menus, however close enough that you should be able to find the bridge setting within that interface as well.
The only thing I would note is if indeed you need to make corrections to bridge mode you will be required 
to factory reset the device, to enable logging into the admin panel.
Hope this helps, please let me know.
