use font book app to look up font names

note that some times you need to boot an app before dealing with it 

note inorder to do some things i.e setup docker with homebrew you need to
`xcode-select --install` no clue why....


also dokcer demon dose not work without homebrew also kinda weird

some times apps just wont be do-able/have to be removed inorder to todo an update


*if it dose not work---run the *.app file first via spotlight** 


homebrew is installed separately so manage it accordingly
